# Posiposts
Recreation of a twitter clone but instead of tweets its posts about things you feel grateful for 

## Things I've learned 
- textarea: I learned to use textarea, not only to post a post, but to add a reply to a post once comment icon is clicked
- .forEach(): I also practiced using the .forEach() method to iterate through array of data and created HTML template that displayed each posts data 
- data-attributes: used to create relationship between icons and which post it belonged to
- conditionally rendering styles: adding styles to HTML only if the condition is met (checking to see if liked icon has been clicked or retweet has been clicked)
- NOT operator (!): used to flip a boolean to increment and decrement count if icon has been clicked
- CDN's: font awesome and generating UUIDS (uuid js)
